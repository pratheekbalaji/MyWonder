# MyWonder
Project Summary

MyWonder is a big data analytics and visualization platform allowing users to create visualizations from massive files under 10 minutes. The same process would earlier take hours testing the patience of end users leaving them unsatisified with the product. 

The current methodology leverages cloud to efficienlty process and distribute files. Users can now upload files from phone and calculate results on the go just before attending meetings
